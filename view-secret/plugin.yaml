  Decodes secrets. If there's only one key in the secret, it's printed.
  If there are multiple keys in the secret, it prints the keys and exits.
  In that case, specify the data key in the secret as another argument.
  Example:
    kubectl plugin view-secret foo
    kubectl plugin view-secret foo key.json
command: ./view-secret.bash
